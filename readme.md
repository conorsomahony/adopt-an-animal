# jQuery Mobile Single Page Application Prototype


## Project Description
* Use jQuery Mobile JavaScript library to build a Single Page list style mobile web application.
* Your list will be dynamically constructed by reading data from a JSON file that you will need to create yourself.
* Clicking on any individual list item will show a virtual “page” presenting some more information about that item.
* Note that this extra info is also dynamically generated from the JSON.
